\chapter{Degree Anonymization over Uncertain Graphs}
\label{chp:d}
In this chapter, I will briefly review the degree anonymization tehcniques I developed for uncertain graphs. These techniques have been submitted as a conference paper \cite{}.

In this work, we study the novel problem of anonymization in the context of uncertain graphs. We extend the existing framework to work over uncertain graph by integrating uncertainty into anonymization process. In particular, we introduce a new {\em reliability-based} utility metric suitable for uncertain graphs, in contrast to the existing metrics which are all geared towards deterministic graphs. We present an efficient approach which achieves the desired level of anonymity at a slight cost of reliability by perturbing edge uncertainties judiciously.  To this purpose, we develop two uncertainty-aware heuristics based on the uncertain graph theory, which is {\em reliability-oriented}~edge selection and {\em anonymity-oriented} edge perturbing.  We show that the incorporation of uncertainty is necessary and beneficial. We experimentally evaluate the proposed approach using different real-world datasets and study the behavior of the algorithms under the different heuristics.  The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
