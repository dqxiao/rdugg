\chapter{Probabiltic Degree Anonymization over Uncertain Graphs}
\label{chp:e}
In this section, we formalize the threat of re-identification combined with the degree probability distributions in the context of uncertain graphs. We study the node degree information incoporates edge uncertainty and show its power to re-identify individual in a uncertain graph. Protecting against the threat of re-identification presents novel challenges for uncertain graph data. Generalization, random perturbation and uncertain graphs methods have been developed for determinitic graph anonymization. It is not trivial to shift these strategies for obfuscating degree probability distributions of nodes in the uncertain graph.
