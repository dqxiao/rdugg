\subsection{Proposed Research Tasks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {We identify and formulate the node re-identification attack using their degree probability distribution, and extend the {\keobf} notation for quantifying privacy level. We present the reliability and privacy preserving problem in the context of uncertain graphs.}
    \item {We show case that a naive approach that simply combines existing techniques do not work in practice due to significant utility loss.}
    \item {We propose a heuristic based on the density estimation of probability distributions among all the vertices in the uncertain graph for injecting perturbation judiciously. We give an efficient and effective method for heuristic evaluation.}
    \item {We propose to explore different search strategy for solving the induced optimized problem in the process of injecting uncertainty. }
    \item {We perform an extensive experimental evaluation using four real-world uncertain graph data sets from different  domains. We evaluate and compare our methods using different groups of graph metrics.}
\end{itemize}
