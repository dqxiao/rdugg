% This is the command for doublespacing when you use the setspace
% package
% Please do NOT use \baselinestretch, this will mess up everything,
% cause earthquakes, tornados and lots of questions for me...
% If you need a singlespaced paragraph (BAD STYLE!!!), use
% \singlespacing or \onehalfspacing and enclose it together with the
% paragraph in braces {\singlespacing This is my text... blah blah blah}

%\doublespacing

% Now you can start to be creative.
% First, you need an abstract.
% Fortunately, LaTeX has thought of that, so it's very easy:

Talking about the focus of this researchh 
% The dissertation focuses on scaling outlier detection to work both on huge static as well as on dynamic, streaming datasets. In general outliers are patterns in the data that do not conform to the expected behavior. Outlier detection techniques are broadly applied in applications ranging from credit fraud prevention, network intrusion detection, stock investment tactical planning to moving object monitoring. For such mission critical applications, a timely response often is of paramount importance. This is a challenging task, since the processing of outlier detection requests is resource consuming due to the algorithmic complexity of the mining process. Within this scope, we focus on three research aspects, namely techniques and systems for continuous outlier detection over streams, distributed outlier detection over massive-scale static data sets and interactive outlier exploration.

Each component with its item 

Experimental studies including performance evaluation and user studies will be conducted on various real datasets to evaluate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches.

% From here on, we need Roman page numbers according to the library
% regulations. So let's assign those.

\pagenumbering{roman} % or {Roman} if you like them capitalized

% The next thing is the Preface (``Acknowledgements'').
% No standard environment for that, so we'll format it by hand.
