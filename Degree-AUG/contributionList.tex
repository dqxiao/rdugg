\section{Contribution List}
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to deal with uncertain graph anonymization aiming at less reliablity change. Our contrinutions inlcudes:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em 
\item{We identify and formalize the new and important problem of privacy preserving publication of uncertain graphs.
	We design a new framework, namely {\em AUG}, for efficient anonymization of uncertain graphs under the {\keobf} anonymization principle. 
	{\em AUG} integrates the edge uncertainties throughout the anonymization process to ensure the desired privacy level.}

\item{We show case that a naive approach that combines existing techniques from literature for uncertain graph 		anonymization do not work in practice due to significant utility loss. 
}

\item{We introduce a new reliability-based utility metric for assessing the utility loss during the anonymization process. We propose uncertainty-aware heuristics for injecting noise and perturbing the graph structure to anonymize the uncertain graph while minimizing utility loss.}	
	
\item{
We perform an extensive experimental evaluation using four real-world uncertain graph data sets from different  domains. We evaluate {\em AUG} using different groups of graph metrics. The results demonstrate a significant advantage of the proposed framework over the naive conventional methods, which do not directly consider edge uncertainty.
