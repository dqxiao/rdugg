\section{Reliability-Preserving anonymization on uncertain graphs}
\end{sloppypar}
\label{sec:tech} 
In this section, we first give a brief review of the state-of-art framework which anonymizes deterministic graphs by injecting uncertainty to certain edges. Then, we discuss how to extend this framework to work over uncertain graphs by explicitly incorporating edge uncertainty.

Boldi {\etal}  proposed a seminal approach of anonymizing \emph{deterministic graphs} which injects uncertainty in the existence of the edges of the graph and publishes the resulting \emph{uncertain graph}. Their method injects uncertainty to edges in a deterministic graph as follows: for each existing sampled edge $e$, it is assigned a probability $1-r_{e}$, and for each non-existing sampled edge $e$, it is assigned a probability $r_{e} \leftarrow R_{\sigma_{e}}$.  By this way, it converts the input graph into an uncertain one. In particular, the perturbation variable $r_{e}$ is generated by a truncated $[0,1]$ normal distribution, $r_{e} \leftarrow R_{\sigma_{e}}$; 
\begin{equation*}
    R_{\sigma}(r):= \begin{cases}
                    \frac{\Phi_{0,\sigma}(r)}{\int_{0}^{1} \Phi_{0,\sigma}(x) dx} &  r \in [0,1] \\
                    0 &  \text{otherwise}
                    \end{cases}
     \label{eq:gen}
\end{equation*} 
where $\Phi_{0,\sigma}$ is the density function of a Gaussian distribution. 
As the standard deviation $\sigma$ of the normal distribution decreases, a greater mass of $R_{\sigma}$ will concentrate near $r=0$ and the amount of injected uncertainty will be smaller.  Namely, smaller values of $\sigma$ contribute towards better maintaining the characteristics of the original graph. Targeting at high utility, they formulated the graph anonymization problem as the minimization of $\sigma$ and computed the minimal amount of uncertainty via a binary search on the value of the uncertainty parameter $\sigma$. The overall anonymization procedure is illustrated in Algorithm \ref{alg:binarySearch}. 

The search flow of Algorithm \ref{alg:binarySearch} is determined by the function \texttt{GenerateObfuscation}, whose pipeline is shown as Figure \ref{fig:genObfuscation}. The function \texttt{GenerateObfuscation} aims to find a $(k,\epsilon)$-obfuscation of the original \emph{graph} using a given standard deviation parameter $\sigma$. A key feature of this function is the utilization of heuristics for judicious edge selection and edge prob perturbing. The function first computes heuristics values based on node properties in the input graph. After that, the search of $\keobf$ instance starts in a randomized way: $t$ attempts are performed. Each attempt performs the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
	\item{Selecting a subset of edges $E_{c}$}
    \item{Perturbing existence probabilities of selected edges}
    \item{Checking the resulting uncertain graph whether satisfies the anonymity requirement}
\end{itemize}
If the algorithm finds a $(k,\epsilon)$-obfuscated graph in one of its $t$ trials, it returns the obfuscated graph with minimal $\epsilon$. Otherwise, the algorithm indicates the failure by returning $\tilde{\epsilon}=1$. 

\begin{sloppypar}
In this work, we extend this broad framework by incorporating its key function \texttt{GenerateObfuscation} with uncertainty. The specific method proposed in \cite{Boldi_Injecting_2012}, has two drawbacks for anonymizing uncertain graphs. First, their method does not consider the structural relevance of edges in the critical edge selection step, which leads to unnecessary structural distortion. Second, its interior edge perturbing mechanism assumes the existence of edges is known with certainty, thus fails to handle uncertain graphs where the existence of edges is probabilistic. We will present corresponding solutions (reliability-oriented edge selection and anonymity-oriented edge perturbing).
