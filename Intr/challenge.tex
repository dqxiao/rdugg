Shifting the graph anonymization techniques to uncertain graphs is challenging. 

Fundamentally, the uncertain graph anonymization techniques required to modify graph structure in some level. The intermediate goal of unccertain graph anonymization is to balance the utility and privacy. The first question we need to solve is to develop proper metrics for quantifying loss of information. In the context of determinitic graph, this problem has been extensively stuided. However, many metrics defiend in determinitic graphs can not be used to uncertain graphs directly since of the ignorance of edge uncertainty.  


The second question is XX (Attack model & Privacy Notation)


The third question is XX  (Effecient Mehtod)
